				<h3>More About Me</h3>
				<p>
					I have studied and put a hight interest in biology, physics and maths but I never gave up on my interest in programming and learning new things.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was given a chance to learn more about programming by my uncle and obviously grasped it and never let go of it. Then as of today I'm still learning more about programming, character designing and improving my communication and teamwork skills, and trying my best to catch up with my uncle's team to help them with the project they're working on.
